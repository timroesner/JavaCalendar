	 * "From File" function through which user can specify a file containing recurring events. 
	 * Recurring events will be scheduled only though this option. The file can contain events for 
	 * the future as well as those from the past. For simplicity, assume that the user of the program
	 *  will use this function only once right after the program starts. When your team submits the soft copy, 
	 *  include input.txt containing at least 10 different events that will processed by this function.
	 *   Note that input.txt will contain recurring events only.
	 *   Each event in the input.txt takes up one line and consists of the following items separated by a semi-colon ;
	 *   	event name: a name can have a space
	 *   	year: 4 digits	
	 *   	starting month: 1 ~ 12
	 *   	ending month: 1 ~ 12
	 *   	days: days will be a sequence of day abbreviations, SMTWHFA, without any space in it. 
	 *   Days can be any order. No space is allowed in days
	 *   	starting time: use 24 hour system (0 ~ 23)
	 *   	ending time: use 24 hour system (0 ~ 23)
	 *   
	 *   For example, the following line schedules Math Class on every M,W,F from January to February 2014. 
	 *   The class starts from 5:00 pm and ends at 6:00 pm on the scheduled date.
	 *   	Math Class;2014;1;2;MWF;17;18;
